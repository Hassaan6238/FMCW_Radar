# FMCW Radar SOC Block Design

Frequency Modulated Continous-Wave Radars are widely used in vehicle radars, atmospheric conditions checking , etc. These radars work solely on principles of doppler effect for distance calculation.

## Procedure to Run:

1) Copy the TCl script from [design_1.tcl](https://github.com/Hassaan6238/FMCW_Radar/blob/main/design_1.tcl) and paste it in your Vivado Terminal.

2) Generate Bitstream

3) Select Export Hardware option from Files dropdown menu.

4) Run SDK.

5) Copy [PS.c](https://github.com/Hassaan6238/FMCW_Radar/blob/main/PS.c) code to your application project.

6) Program the FPGA by selecting Launch on Hardware (System Debugger).
